## Question 1
Write a program to reverse an array or string using loop
<br />
 input: [ 1, 2, 3 ] <br />
 output: [ 3, 2, 1 ]<br />

## Question 2
Write a program to combine two arrays <br />

 firstInput =  [ 1, 2, 3 ]  <br />
 secondInput = [ 4, 5, 6 ]  <br />

Output: = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  <br />

## Question 3 
Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative. <br />

Input:  [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3 <br />
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4] <br />
# Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6] <br />
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]<br />
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]<br />

## Question 4 
Create a nested Create a nested for loops produce the loops produce the <br />
following output.

....1 <br />
...22<br />
..333<br />
.4444<br />
55555<br />

## Question 5 

Given an array of integers, find the pair of adjacent elements that has the largest product and return that product.

Example

For inputArray = [3, 6, -2, -5, 7, 3], the output should be
adjacentElementsProduct(inputArray) = 21.

7 and 3 produce the largest product.

## Question 6 
Below we will define an n-interesting polygon. Your task is to find the area of a polygon for a given n.


Example
n= 1, output = 1;
For n = 2, the output should be
output= 5;
For n = 3, the output should be
output= 13.
For n = 4, the output should be
output = 25.


## Question 7 

Given the string, check if it is a palindrome.

Example

For inputString = "aabaa", the output should be
 = true;
For inputString = "abac", the output should be
 = false;
For inputString = "a", the output should be
 = true.

## Question 8 

Given a year, return the century it is in. The first century spans from the year 1 up to and including the year 100, the second - from the year 101 up to and including the year 200, etc.

Example

For year = 1905, the output should be
 = 20;
For year = 1700, the output should be
 = 17.

## Question 9 
Count frequencies of each entry in an array
For example 
const fruitBasket = ['banana', 'cherry', 'orange', 'apple', 'cherry', 'orange', 'apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange', 'fig' ];

It should return an object like this 
{ banana: 2, cherry: 3, orange: 3, apple: 2, fig: 1 }

## Question 10 
Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

For example, the square matrix  is shown below: <br />

1 2 3  <br />
4 5 6  <br />
9 8 9  <br />
The left-to-right diagonal = . The right to left diagonal = . Their absolute difference is . <br />

Function description<br />

Complete the  function in the editor below. <br />

diagonalDifference takes the following parameter: <br />

int arr[n][m]: an array of integers <br />

Return <br />
int: the absolute diagonal difference <br />

Sample Input <br />

3              <br />
11 2 4         <br />
4 5 6          <br />
10 8 -12      <br />
Sample Output  <br />

15  <br />

## Question 11

Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line with  places after the decimal.


## Sample Input <br />
-4 3 -9 0 4 1        <br /> 
## Sample Output <br />

0.500000 <br />
0.333333 <br />
0.166667 <br />
# Explanation <br />

There are 3  positive numbers, 2 negative numbers, and 1 zero in the array. <br />
The proportions of occurrence are positive: 3/6 = 0.500000, negative: 2/6= 0.333333, 1/6= 0.166667 and zeros <br />




Output Format <br />

Print the following  lines, each to decimals: <br />

proportion of positive values <br />
proportion of negative values <br />
proportion of zeros <br />

# Explanation <br />

There are 3  positive numbers, 2 negative numbers, and 1 zero in the array. <br />
The proportions of occurrence are positive: 3/6 = 0.500000, negative: 2/6= 0.333333, 1/6= 0.166667 and zeros <br />




Output Format <br />

Print the following  lines, each to decimals: <br />

proportion of positive values <br />
proportion of negative values <br />

## Question 12 

Given the list of items and their actual prices and sold prices. Find the number of items in sold products which has wrong prices

Example Input

Products = ['eggs', 'milk', 'cheese'];  <br />
productPrices = [2.89, 3.29, 5.79];  <br />
productSold = ['eggs', 'eggs', 'cheese', 'milk']  <br />
soldPrice = [2.89, 2.99, 5.97, 3.29];  <br />


Example Output
Here   <br />
eggs has 2.99 price which is worng 
milk has 5.97 price which is worng 
So we will return 2 in this example.
